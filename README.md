# Chinook Data Analysis and Chatbot

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`chatWithChinook.ipynb`) that demonstrates data analysis on the Chinook sample database using Python and MySQL. Additionally, it includes the integration of a chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI's LLM (Large Language Model).

## Introduction

The Chinook dataset is a sample database that represents a digital media store. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL server, run SQL queries on the Chinook database, visualize data using Matplotlib, and create a chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI's LLM.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL server
- MySQL connector for Python
- Matplotlib
- LangChain
- OpenAI's LLM

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter matplotlib langchain transformers
